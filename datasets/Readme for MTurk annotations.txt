The file MTurk_annotations.csv contains the results of the MTurk surveys. The details of the survey can be found in the paper "Meaning in colexification: beyound single edges and towards a network perspective" by Di Natale, Gander and Garcia.
The file has 3 columns: "inputs", "outputs" and "workerID" and is separated by ;

"inputs" are the list of word pairs that were shown in each questionnaire;
"outputs" are the list of ordered outputs to the questions in the column "inputs". The outputs are on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means "not at all similar", 2 "slightly similar", 3 "moderately similar", 4 "very similar" and 5 "extremely similar". "dunno" indicates that the worker was not familiar with at least one of the two words shown, and 6 indicates that the worker pressed the button "do not choose this option".
"workerID" are the IDs of the workers anonymised with respect to the MTurk IDs.
